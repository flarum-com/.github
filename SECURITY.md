# Security Policy

## How to disclose

Please use [our contact form](https://flarum.org/contact?for=security) for security issues that affect any of the code in our repositories. If you believe you have found a vulnerability on the Flarum project, please disclose it via [this form](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https://github.com/flarum/core).

This will enable us to **review** the vulnerability, **fix** it promptly, and perhaps **reward** you for your efforts.

If you have any questions about the process, feel free to reach out to security@flarum.org.
